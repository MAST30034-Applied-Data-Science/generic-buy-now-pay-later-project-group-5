# About Datapacks

DataPacks contain comprehensive data about people, families and dwellings for all Census geographies ranging from Australia down to Statistical Area Level 1 (SA1). They are containers of data based on Census Community Profiles and include digital boundary information, metadata and reference documents to enable you to read the data. 

Metadata files contain information required to enable you to match the data with the Community Profile template, such as information about sequential numbers and labels, digital boundaries, table descriptors, and the population that is being counted. The Metadata folder also contains the geographical description file: 2021Census_geog_desc_1st_2nd_3rd_release.xlsx

DataPacks do not include software.

# Using the DataPacks
You can use DataPacks if you:

• want to use the data with your own database or analysis systems
• want Community Profile data for numerous geographic areas

# Datapack Descriptors
Short descriptors were created for use with Geographic Information Systems (GIS). Short descriptors (up to 29 characters) are available in the data.  
Should you require data using long or sequential descriptors you can replace headers within the CSVs using descriptor information available in the Metadata file contained in the zip file. For example, the Metadata_2021_GCP_DataPack contains a listing of all sequential, short and long descriptor information.

# Sample DataPacks
Sample DataPacks contain the data structure ie. geography boundaries and Census item descriptors but no Census data. They are available for download from http://www.abs.gov.au/AUSSTATS/abs@.nsf/DetailsPage/2079.02016?OpenDocument on the ABS website now. 

# Release dates for DataPacks
The DataPacks release schedule can be found at 2021 Census product release guide | Australian Bureau of Statistics (abs.gov.au)

# Summary of Community Profiles
The Community Profiles are released in two phases. First release tables are those containing variables which are relatively easy to process and will be available on release day. Second release tables will contain variables which require more complex processing and will be available on the second release day.
Basis for counting people
• 'Place of usual residence' data counts people where they usually live.
• 'Place of enumeration' is the place at which the person is counted i.e., where they spent Census Night, which may not be where they usually live.  
• 'Place of work' data provides information on where a person goes to work.

# Additivity of data
Please note that there are small random adjustments made to all cell values to protect the confidentiality of data. These adjustments may cause the sum of rows or columns to differ by small amounts from the table totals.

# Templates
The templates provide an easy way for you to visualise all data cells available in the data files. They contain the formatted tables and the corresponding cell reference numbers. The templates are in the Metadata folder.
